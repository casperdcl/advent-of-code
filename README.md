# Advent of Code solutions

[![Tests](https://github.com/casperdcl/advent-of-code/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/casperdcl/advent-of-code/actions)

Solutions to problems from <https://adventofcode.com/2020>, <https://adventofcode.com/2021>, and <https://adventofcode.com/2022>.

```sh
conda env create
conda activate aoc
python3 -m aoc --help
```

- readability: style nearly production-worthy (i.e. maintainability is more important than amusing code golf)
- scalability: sane run times even if the input was significantly larger (avoid brute force just because the input is currently tiny)

Suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
