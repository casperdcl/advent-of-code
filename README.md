```sh
conda env create
conda activate aoc
python3 -m aoc --help
```

- readability: style nearly production-worthy (i.e. maintainability is more important than amusing code golf)
- scalability: sane run times even if the input was significantly larger (avoid brute force just because the input is currently tiny)
